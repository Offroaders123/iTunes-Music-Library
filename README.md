# iTunes Music Library

A parser for the iTunes Music Library format!

I realized it might be a worthwhile thing to look into the format of the music library for the modern Music app on macOS, as well as iTunes. Some of the songs and albums in my library could use some better categorization and metadata adjustments, but I either have to a lot of the changes manually in the app, with each song, or there isn't even an option to edit the things I want to adjust myself. One example is that the Date Added metadata for various songs have changed to be much sooner than they were originally, making the organization/sorting of my library inaccurate to the dates that I added them to my library. I wish I could set them back to their proper times, so they appear in the correct order as to when I found them. Say for an album I added probably 6 years ago. Sometimes if you edit the album enough, it gets re-categorized into being a completely new album, meaning it shows up as being recently added. I want to set it back to 6 years ago, so it's shown next to other albums I found during that same time.

It looks like this format is kind of documented, partially well, but some of it may still be a mystery as to how it works. It would be great to be able to manipulate it 1:1 just like I've figured out for NBT files.
